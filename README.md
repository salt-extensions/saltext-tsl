# TSL

**T**he **S**tate **L**ibrary aims to provide a way to view state files documentation, similar to `sys.doc`.

To document a state file you can add the following section to the top of the state:

```
#START-DOC
# File_name: state.sls
# Author: XXXXXX
# Description:
# Grains:
# Pillars:
# Syntax: XXXXXX
#END-DOC
```
